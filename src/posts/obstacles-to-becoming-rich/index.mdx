# Making Money

Yes, there are obstacles for the have-nots in this world to rise and make money,but it&#39;s not that they could not be overcome. Countless people in the past have done that and you can too. For that, you need to start saving and investing now.

I started with a mere 5k rupee, equivalent to less than 100 USD and did not have any more money to invest for 4 months after that. Did it make me a millionaire? No, but it was a start and I think the 1st major obstacle between a person making money and being broke is getting started with a mindset.

Start investing small.

Your friends ate at MacDonald&#39;s but you &#39;liked&#39; the sandwich your mom made you, saved a thousand rupee and invested it.

Two new suits at a function were &#39;overkill&#39; and you made do with only one, saved a couple of thousand and invested it.

A bit from here, a bit from there and you will start accumulating and be surprised how fast these 100s will add up.

Increasing wealth is an exponential process going 1 to 1000 is equally difficult as going from 1000 to million and million to billion. So keep this in mind the wealth accumulation will get faster and faster.

And lastly, don&#39;t talk to anyone about how much you have invested in the start and what are your ambitions. People will mock you, like, only 10k, and like, you will be rich when you are 100.

Pakistan is a very high-growth potential market. In my opinion, the investments will go 50-fold in 20 years.

**This is the time to invest.**
