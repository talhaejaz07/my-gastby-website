**Rant Alert**

Army officers in Pakistan act like their mother brought this country in her dowry, they treat the constitution of Pakistan as tissue paper used and abused. Not a single one of the generals has shown any remorse for breaking the constitution, the same constitution which makes their job possible.

Breaking the constitution is like blowing up the very foundations of the country. Anyone who has power can do no bigger sin than breaking the constitution.

The country owes nothing to a general who served 40 years, for which he was paid handsomely. From where it is written that if you are in the army you can do anything and there will be no repercussions. The filthy generals will protect you even after you have been disposed of power. General Yahya Khan broke the country, he should have been hanged but he was seen doing morning walks in Harley Street Pindi wasting oxygen for many years even after being disposed of power.

They say,

> These soldiers (read: Generals) have given their life to this country!

You tell me if a Muslim prays for 40 years will he be allowed to drink wine then?

The army officers do not come to the institution to serve the country. They just want a secure future and want to gain monetary benefits, so if there is some virus in their brain that they own us then honestly they need to get checked.

**Rant over**
