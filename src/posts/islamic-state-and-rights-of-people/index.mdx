# Islamic State and Rights of People

Abdullah ibn Umar reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said,

> “Every one of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. The leader of the people is a guardian and is responsible for his subjects. A man is the guardian of his family and he is responsible for them. A woman is the guardian of her husband’s home and his children and she is responsible for them. The servant of a man is a guardian of the property of his master and he is responsible for it. No doubt, every one of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock.”

**Bukhari, 7138**

For like 99% history of Islam, Muslims have not run the Islamic States but medieval kingdoms in which religion, in this case, Islam, was used as a tool to control the masses and a source of legitimacy. So, asking for the rights of the common folk in that kind of situation is just lying to yourself and anyone glorifying that era as a golden age for a common man is just oblivious or dishonest.

The reason to write this post is the question in my mind that what rights enjoyed by the subject of an Islamic State are intentions of Islam and what are the quirks and customs of Tribal Arabic society mixed in and not intension of Islam. Are there any provisions which were clearly for that time only and not compatible with our culture and time?

We have in the past deprecated things and values mentioned in Islamic texts. There are no slaves in our society today. For most of history, we had slaves Islam gives guidelines for this institution but let’s be real slavery was not abolished by the effect of Islam. I am glad this heinous institution is gone, but the point I am making here is that slavery is abolished in most Islamic States in this day and age. We have taken away a right that a Muslim theoretically have and no one says it's un-Islamic.

_My question is how far this can be pushed?_ What are the premodern era privileges of Muslims (Muslim men, not women, we are all equally good at oppressing women) which are harmful to our modern society and/or incompatible with our culture?
